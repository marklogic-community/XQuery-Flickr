Hello,

This repository contains an XQuery implementation of the Flickr API.

A few notes:

* In a rather heavy-handed move, I've simply appropriated
  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/ as the namespace for this
  module.

* You'll need to get your own API key, secret, and auth token.

* If you're not using MarkLogic Server, you'll have to provide
  your own implementation of md5() and http-get().

* I move all of the Flickr responses into the Flickr namespace.
  You don't like namespaces? Then remove the call to flickr:_fixns().

Docs, etc. to follow. (In the fullness of time, like the next ice age,
probably. If you have questions, feel free to ask.) The example in
default.xqy might be enough to get you started.
